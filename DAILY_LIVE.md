you have to give the k th smallest val.

```
x1 = 0,
x1 = a,
x3 = b,
xi = xi-1 + xi-2 - xi-3 for i >3

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three space-separated integers A, B, and K, as mentioned in the statement.
1≤T≤10 ^ 5
1≤A,B,K≤10 ^ 9
```

- the graph of xi keeps increasing and decreasing
- but overall keeps increasing.
- pattern =
